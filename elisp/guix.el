;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs-Guix (aka "guix.el") provides featureful visual interface for
;; the GNU Guix package manager.  It allows you:
;;
;; - to search for packages and to look at their code (package recipes);
;;
;; - to manage your Guix profile(s) by installing/removing packages;
;;
;; - to look at, compare and remove profile generations;
;;
;; - to do many other things.
;;
;; Run "M-x guix-help" to look at the summary of available commands.

;;; Code:

(defgroup guix nil
  "Interface for the GNU Guix package manager."
  :prefix "guix-"
  :group 'external)

(defgroup guix-faces nil
  "Guix faces."
  :group 'guix
  :group 'faces)

(provide 'guix)
