This branch (=gh-pages=) provides the contents of the Emacs-Guix
website, which is automatically deployed by github as
[[https://alezost.github.io/guix.el/]].

=html= pages for the website are generated in 2 steps (performed by
=make= command):

- The main step is generating the pages from the Guile code (placed in
  [[file:scheme]] directory) using [[https://haunt.dthompson.us/][Haunt]].
- Since Haunt makes single-line files, and these files are under version
  control, they need to be split up into multiple lines.  This is done
  with the [[http://www.html-tidy.org/][HTML Tidy]] tool.
