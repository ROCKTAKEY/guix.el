* About

=Emacs-Guix= (aka =guix.el=) provides various features and tools
for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/][GNU Guix]] package manager.

It allows you to manage your Guix profile(s) from Emacs: to install,
upgrade and remove packages, to switch and remove profile generations,
to display all available info about packages and to do many other
things.

If you are [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] user, note that [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][Evil Collection]] provide key bindings for
Emacs-Guix.

This README provides only a basic overview on Emacs-Guix, for a full and
detailed description, see the [[https://alezost.github.io/guix.el/manual/latest/html_node/index.html][info manual]] that comes with it.

In short, Emacs-Guix provides the following features:

- Interface for:

  + profiles

  + profile generations (including system generations for GuixSD)

  + packages

  + services

  + package licenses

  + package and service locations

  + [[https://hydra.gnu.org][Hydra build farm]]

- Magit-like popup interface for all guix shell commands (=M-x guix=).

- Modes to view logs of package builds (=guix-build-log-mode= and
  =guix-build-log-minor-mode=).

- Minor mode to "prettify" store file names (to replace hash parts with
  "â€¦").

- Shell completions for all guix commands and options (for =M-x shell=
  and =M-x eshell=).

- Minor mode with additional functionality for =scheme-mode= to work
  with Guix .scm files, particularly with package modules
  (=guix-devel-mode=).

On the following screenshot you can see one of the mentioned features,
namely: "list" and "info" interface for Guix packages (this screenshot
was made for an early version of Emacs-Guix, the interface has slightly
changed since then).

([[https://github.com/alezost/alect-themes][alect-light]] theme is used there).

* Installation

Emacs-Guix can be installed using Guix, from [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]], or it can be used
from a git checkout.  *Note* that it is not recommended to mix several
installations (in particular, Guix and MELPA), as it may lead to
incompatibilities in the source (=.scm=) and compiled (=.go=) Guile
files (see [[https://github.com/alezost/guix.el/issues/21][issue 21]]).

** Guix

Just use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
guix package -i emacs-guix
#+END_SRC

** MELPA

If you added "melpa" or "melpa-stable" archives to =package-archives= as
it is described on the [[http://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA Getting Started]] page, you can install
"emacs-guix" using =M-x package-install= or =M-x list-packages=
commands.

** Git checkout

Also you can clone this git repository and use Emacs-Guix from this git
checkout (see the info manual for details).

Finally, if you have the git checkout, you can install Guix package for
the current commit of Emacs-Guix using [[file:guix.scm]] file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
guix package --install-from-file=guix.scm
#+END_SRC
